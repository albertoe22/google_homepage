This project is a review of HTML and CSS, in which I will try to recreate the google homepage using HTML and CSS.

Edit: Self-reflection
Through this project I learned most of the basics of HTML and CSS, such as using selector tags, what element to use, and how to lay out a website.
I felt I struggled most with trying to get the navigation bar to line up correctly, as my list would push the otherside downwards. I fixed the problem
by making a different list for the left and right part of the navigation bars. Overall, this was challenging but fun to see the website come to life
as I was writing in HTML and CSS.
